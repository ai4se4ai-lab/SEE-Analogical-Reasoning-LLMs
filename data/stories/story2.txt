# The Database Indexing Journey

Emma, a database administrator at a growing e-commerce platform, was facing challenges with increasingly slow query performance as their product catalog expanded to millions of items. Initially, the database used simple sequential scans for all queries. Emma first implemented basic B-tree indexes on the most frequently queried columns, which improved performance for exact matches and range queries. As the system grew more complex with varied query patterns, Emma explored specialized indexing strategies. She implemented hash indexes for exact-match queries on certain fields, bitmap indexes for low-cardinality columns used in analytics, and full-text search indexes for product descriptions. The team then faced a challenge with multi-condition queries that couldn't efficiently use single-column indexes. Emma implemented composite indexes and covering indexes that included all fields referenced in common queries, eliminating the need to access the actual table data. Through careful analysis of query patterns and selective application of appropriate indexing techniques, Emma transformed the database performance while balancing the trade-offs between query speed, update overhead, and storage requirements.
